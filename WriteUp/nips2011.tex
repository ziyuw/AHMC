% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two commands
% used to separate the names and addresses of multiple authors: \And and \AND.
%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to \LaTeX{} to determine where to break
% the lines. Using \AND forces a linebreak at that point. So, if \LaTeX{}
% puts 3 of 4 authors names on the first line, and the last on the second
% line, try using \AND instead of \And before the third author name.

% General introduction
A common problem in physics, statistics and machine learning is to draw samples from probability distributions $\pi(\cdot)$ that is only known up to a normalization constant. Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms \cite{robert2004monte} are one of few methods available to accomplish these sampling tasks.

% Introduce Bayesian optimization and its shortcomings
